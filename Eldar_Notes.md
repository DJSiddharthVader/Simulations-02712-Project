# Notes on Eldar 2011

## Assumptions:
- Very basic assumption is that QS directly controls the levels the
public good production
- Signal production is constitutive and quorum response is density dependent function of signal-bound receptor
- QS system is composed of 3 genes encoding signaling molecule (S), receptor molecule (R), and public good product
- The public good is a secreted enzyme whose product is a usable nutrient
- Growth rate is dependent on the level of usable nutrient, Hollings type II term
- Producing the public good reduces growth rate
- Density dependent cell death, leading to a logistic form of growth equation
- In the two divergent allele model (R1,R2) and (S1,S2), only 1 mutation allows the transition between alleles. R1 can only bind S1 and R2 can only bind S2
- Analyzed competition of strains in a population evolving thru a bottle neck
- Multiple subpopulations where in each round N lineages are selected to seed each subpopulation and growth for a given amount of time. After growth phase bacteria are resampled either from the same population (local competition) or from the entire population (global competition) to seed the next growth cycle
-The public good is an Exo-enzyme (E), that  catalyzes the cleavage of a complex nutrient (P) into a transportable form (P_d)
- Level of P is constant  
- A fraction r of the growth potential is diverted from growth to enzyme production @ max production level
- Quorum response function is a monotonically increasing function with maximum of 1
- R & S interaction occurs on a much faster time scale so they are in a quasi steady state and levels of receptor is constant --> Michaelis Menton Relationship between [RS] and S
- Quorum response form f(x) = x^m
