### Compiling Documents

Requires:
  - `GNU make`
  - `pandoc`

I created a Makefile for running the pandoc commands to compile the documents more easily.
You can compile the documents with the Makefile as follows

```bash
$ make outline   # make the outline ./Documents/outline/outline.pdf
$ make slides    # make the slides ./Documents/presentation/slides.pdf
$ make report    # make the final report ./Documents/report/report.pdf
$ make documents # all of the above
```
