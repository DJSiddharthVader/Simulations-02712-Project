"""
Code to generate matrices for input to the QS model,
ultimately to see how different matrices affect model dynamics.

Specifically the matrix K_ac is defined @eldar_2011, but it
represents compatible signal molecule-receptor pairs that
are present in a given OTU in the population

All matrices are binary (either the receptor-signal pair is present
or not), so one can define the set of signals and receptors in each strain
to make this matrix.
If there are
Lets say strain 1 is R1S1 and strain 2 R2S2, this corresponds
If strain 1 is R1S1 and strain 2 R0S0 (no receptors or signals),
this corresponds the following matrix.

         1 0
         0 0

If strain 1 is R1S1S2 and strain 2 R2S2, these strains correspond
to the following matrix

         1 0
         1 1

In this code we only generate matrices but we could generate random
combinations of receptor and singals and use these to build the matrix.
For the empirically derived matrix from [@citation_needed] this is how
we build K_ac, looking at the signal-receptor sets for each strain.

Note that a given matrix can result from different R-S combinnation
among the strains.
Also @eldar_2011 also defines an inhibhitory matrix K_in but we ignore
that matrix, which is equiivalent as having it be all zeros (i.e.
no inhibhitory QS interactions).
