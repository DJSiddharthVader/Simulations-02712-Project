Plotting utilities to generate figures

Plot idea:
 - plot gif of k_ac (decreasing sparsity) and model dynamics (1 k_ac per frame
 - left half is heatmap of K_ac matrix (0=white, 1=color)
 - right half is entire simulation of the model (all time steps for that K_ac)
 - x axis is time, y axis could be
   - model dynamics (just strain abundances as lines)
   - model properties (alpha/beta diversity, growth rate, etc.)
